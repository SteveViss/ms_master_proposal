\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Context.}  The boreal region is warming twice as fast as the global
average and will inevitably alter species composition in boreal forest
\cite{Scheffer2012,Hughes2000}.  Sugar maple is one of those species expected to
migrate northward towards it's nordic temperate forest limits
\cite{McKENNEY2007,Goldblum2005}. Predict shifts in the repartition of sugar
maple under climate change is an important challenge whereas this species is
highly coveted by hardwood and maple syrup producers, two main economic sectors
in Quebec. Indeed, Sugar maple is a widespread and abundant tree in north-
eastern North America and one of the most representative species of northern
temperate forests \cite{Graignic2013,Messaoud2007,Kellman2004}. This northward
migration will result in increasing the surface of the ecotone between the
boreal and temperate forest of Quebec. Nevertheless, the expansion of species
distribution occuring in Nordic temperate forest could be difficult and explain
by the fact than microclimatic conditions found in boreal forests are different
from those present in temperate forest. Colder temperatures from shading and
excess soil moisture due to snow melt cause litter to be more acidic and fibrous
during the spring. Therefore, even if the regional climate conditions are
favorable \cite{Kellman2004}, the microbiota conditions found in the boreal
forest could affect the establishment of sugar
maple\cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008,DeFrenne2013}. In this case, the sugar maple
could be unable to migrate in boreal forests as a result of negative soil
feedback. This phenomen could increase the tension between the boreal forest and
the nordic temperate forest and generating abrupt changes in the community
composition (\textbf{$H_0$}). \textbf{Objectives.} This project aim to develop a
state and transition model (STM) between the boreal and temperate nordic forest
in order to investigate shifts in the distribution of sugar maple into the
boreal-temperate forest dynamical system.To assess this main objective, we will
(1) generate a transitional model between the temperate and the boreal forest;
(2) investigate the spatial structure of the transitonnal zone; and finaly (3)
run simulations based on different climate change scenarios. To realized those
objectives, we will use the alternative stable states theory as a framework. In
order to define the context of this study, the first section is a review
subdivided into two paragraphs. The first part will present the theorical
context on the alternative stable states and abrupt changes in ecosystems
functionning. Second part of this section will focus on the Sugar maple and his
community and thus explain why is alternative stable states a relevant framework
to study the dynamic of the boreal-temperate forests ecotone.  The second
section of this document will describe the model and the methodology employed to
assess the objectives. To conclude, the last part will present the general
timeline associated to this project. \section{Review}  \textbf{Theorical
framework.}  Many ecotone studies and modeling efforts on transition between
forest to none-forest ecosystems (e. i. Boreal - Toundra)
\cite{Scheffer2012,Scheffer2001,Hirota2011} but little attention has been given
to evaluate the transitional dynamics of forest- forest ecotone
\cite{Goldblum2010,Graignic2013}. At large scale, transition between  the
temperate nordic and the boreal forests can be approach as a dynamic system
where each forest biomes is a state. The presence of different states at a
location or a time depends on environmental conditions (e. i. Soil, temperature)
encountered by the system. When small environnemental fluctuations occurs,
mostly dynamical system can respond almost linearly with no particular threshold
to observe drastic changes in state of the ecosystem ( Figure \ref{fig1} .A)
\cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009}. Thus, increase the soil moisture might cause
favorable conditions to a new species, but doesn't affect the functionning of
the ecosystem. In this case, only one equilibrium can be observed given a
specific environnemental condition
\cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009,scheffer2009critical}. Another kind of system
response occurs more frequently in nature.  Natural systems are rather
insensitive over certain ranges of environnementals conditions while responding
strongly when a treshold is reached by the system (Figure \ref{fig1} .B)
\cite{scheffer2009critical}. Tree mortality can increase sharply when a specific
toxicant level is added in the environment. \cite{scheffer2009critical}. Thus
small forcing in the natural system can conduct at large changements as the
entire transformation in species community composition. In an other hand, the
respond curve can be folded backwards and the same threshold can conduct the
system into catastrophic changes (Figure \ref{fig1} .C). In this situation, the
system present alternative stable states who mean the possibility to get two
different contrasted stable state for a certain range of environnemental
conditions, called hysteresis zone (Figure \ref{fig1} .C).  When a system
present a state on    . In the Boreal-temperate nordic forest ecotone, there is
no distinct boundary instead, a broad transition zone exists composed of mixed
stands of coniferous and deciduous species \cite{Goldblum2010}. At large scale,
a macromosaic landscape with pure stands of deciduous trees on favorable sites
and pure coniferous stands on less favorable sites found on poor soils
\cite{Goldblum2010}. Assuming this fact, the alternative stable states is a
relevant framework to study this ecotone dynamic therefore the soil seems to
have a negative feedback on the temperate forest establishment and need to be
investigate has a main attractor in alternative stable states. \\

\section{Methods}   

\textbf{Models.} This state and transition model will be based on four
differents states characterizing the boreal and nothern temperate forests
landscape: \textbf{(D)} Decidious; \textbf{(C)} Coniferious; \textbf{(M)}
Mixed stand and finaly \textbf{(T)} Transitional stand (Figure \ref{Model}).
We will assume that all space is occupied by one state, so that the
proportions of land cover occupied by all types of patch sum to 1. Each patch
contained within the model could be disturbe (i. e. fire in boreal forest or
gaps dynamic in temperate nordic forest) with a rate of $e$. Following a
perturbation, the patchs will composed by transitional species and recovered
to a specific states C, D or M with a rate of $\phi$. This parameter take in
account a patch specific recovery rate, called $\alpha_{C,D,M}$ varying with
the proportion of this available in the neighborhood and
the rate which this hasn't been convert to an another type of
stand.  Whereas parameters previously enumerated, this model can be formally
describe by this set of differential equations:

%\frac{\delta C}{\delta t} = \alpha_C \cdot (C+M) \cdot (1-\alpha_D \cdot (D+M)) \cdot (1-C-D-M) + S_C \cdot M - \%beta_D \cdot (D+M) \cdot C - e \cdot C%
%\frac{\delta D}{\delta t} = \alpha_D \cdot (D+M) \cdot (1-\alpha_C \cdot (C+M)) \cdot (1-C-D-M) + S_D \cdot M - %\%beta_C \cdot (C+M) \cdot D - e \cdot D
%\frac{\delta M}{\delta t} = \alpha_C \cdot (C+M) \cdot \alpha_D \cdot (D+M) \cdot (1-C-D-M) + \beta_C \cdot (C+M) + \beta_D \cdot (D+M) - S_C \cdot M - S_D \cdot M - e \cdot M

\caption{Conceptual transition model between forest stands deciduous ($D$), mixte ($M$) and coniferious ($C$). $T$ corresponds to a transitionnal state where a perturbation are occurred with a frequence of $e$. Parameters $\beta$ and $S$ are referred as the colonisation and the succession rates respectively. We defined the recovery rates ($\phi_C$ et $\phi_D$) as $\phi_C = \alpha_C \cdot (M+C) \cdot [1- \alpha_D \cdot (D +M)]$ and $\phi_D = \alpha_D \cdot (D+M) \cdot [1- \alpha_C \cdot (C +M)]$, to finaly get this equation $\phi_M = \phi_C \cdot \phi_D$. The parameter $\alpha$ mean the recovery rate after a patch has been disturbe.}

\textbf{Paramerization.} The parameterization of this model will be
conducted on the QUICC-FOR database containing large permanent sample plots
surveys. Those data are provided by several forest offices and cover multiple
canadian provinces ($\pm16 000$ plots) and states (\textbf{Ask at Miranda} plots).
These inventories started since the 1970s and include all stems measurements
and forest stand informations relative to a specific plot location and year. In a first
time, the basal area will be compute to provide a measure of relative growth
by species present in the plots. \\

\textbf{Simulation.} This model will be incorporated in a spatially explicit cellular automaton or lattice in
order to evaluate the velocity of the transition into differents patches and differents
climate change scenario.
