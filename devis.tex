\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Context.} Sugar maple (\textit{Acer saccharum}) is a widespread and
abundant tree species in north-eastern North America.
\cite{Graignic2013,Messaoud2007,Kellman2004,Barras1998}. Predicting shifts of
the range of Sugar maple is of prime importance because this species is highly
desirable for hardwood and maple syrup production, two large economic sectors
in Quebec. This species is dominating the temperate forest up to the boreal-temperate 
ecotone at its northern range limit \cite{Barras1998}. Some
representative species of northern forest ecosystems are expected to expand
their distribution towards the north following climate warming
\cite{Sciences2014,Iverson2002}. According to McKenney (2007)
\cite{Sciences2014}, the climatic conditions  favorable to Sugar maple  will
reach the Ungava bay within the next 100 years, which appears highly
improbable because of dispersal limitations and slow population dynamics. This
prediction relies on a species distribution model accounting only for climatic
conditions; it is recognized that Sugar maple regeneration depends both on
macro  (\textit{i.e.} regional climate) and micro environmental conditions
(\textit{i.e.} soil and microtopography) \cite{Graignic2013,Lafleur2010}. De
Frenne \textit{et al.} (2013) revealed that shifts in species distribution in
reaction to climate change can be mitigated by the microconditions (i.e. soil
temperature within the forest understory) rather than the macroconditions (i.e
temperature rising at regional scale). Hence, the microconditions (e.g. soil,
drainage) could delayed future sugar maple establishement towards the boreal
forest.\\

Soil-plant feedbacks are susceptible to impact sugar maple migration dynamics.
Soil properties found in boreal forests differ from those in temperate forest
\cite{Lafleur2010,Barras1998,Goldblum2010,Demers1998}. A deep and poorly-decomposed  
litter layer is usually found in boreal forests, while the litter
of  northern hardwood forests is thinner and mainly composed of a superficial
leaf mat \cite{Barras1998}. The temperature is colder, the snow melts later
and the soil is wetter under coniforous trees \cite{Lafleur2010,Goldblum2010}.
Acid soils in coniferous forest causes a reduction in the cation exchange
capacity and subsequently decreases availability of some nutrients such as
calcium \cite{Moore2008}. Sugar maple seedlings have been recognized to be
particularly sensitive to waterlogged conditions and soil nutrient content
\cite{Moore2008,Lafleur2010,Cleavitt2011}. These properties of coniferous
forest soils could hinder the local establishment of species associated with
alkaline soils or unable to withstand waterlogged conditions
\cite{Lafleur2010}. Migration of temperate tree species is likely to be
restricted or delayed by the dominance of coniferous trees \cite{Lafleur2010}.
Thus, even if the climatic conditions at the regional scale become favorable
to Sugar maple after climate warming, the micro conditions found in the boreal
forest could slow seedling establishment
\cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008,Barras1998,Messier2011}. Sugar maple could thus be
unable to colonize the boreal forests as a result of strong and localized
soil-plant feedbacks \cite{McCarthyNeumann2012}.\\

My general hypothesis that the temperate-boreal forest ecotone is as a system
dominated by two alternative states, \textit{i.e.} contrasted equilibrium
states occurring in the same climate conditions \cite{scheffer2009critical}:
the boreal community and the temperate community, including Sugar maple. Under
this hypothesis, the landscape would be a patch mosaic where micro conditions
and stand history are driving the spatial occurrence of boreal and temperate
communities, despite a regional climate favourable to temperate species
\cite{Goldblum2010,Fisichelli2013}. I expect that a climate warming and the
subsequent incapacity of Sugar maple to colonize boreal forest stands will
create  tension between the potential and realized forest composition and
consequently that abrupt shifts in community composition are susceptible to
occur at the boreal-temperate forest ecotone.\\

\textbf{Objectives.} The main objective of this project is to investigate the
role of alternative stable states in the transition between the boreal and temperate
forests under different climate change scenarios. In this context, we will
test two specific hypotheses: ($H_1$) Alternative stable states do co-occur at
the boreal-temperate forests ecotone, and ($H_2$) the response of Sugar maple
to climate change will be delayed in areas where alternative stable states are
susceptible to occur. In order to fulfill this objective and test these
hypotheses, we will (1) develop a climate-dependent state-transition model
(STM) representing the dynamics of the boreal and temperate communities at the
landscape scale; (2) study the occurrence of alternative stable states at the
temperate-boreal ecotone; and finally (3) run simulations of the temperate
community species distribution under different climate change scenarios. The
first section of this proposal reviews the context of the study. I present
the concept of alternative stable states and critical transitions in forest
ecosystem properties. Then after I focus on Sugar maple, its associated
community in the temperate biome, and a justification about why alternative
stable states are expected to occur at the boreal-temperate forests ecotone.
The last section of this proposal describes the model and the methodology that
we will employ to achieve the specific objectives.

\section{Review} 

\textbf{Alternative stable states.} A community is stable when it persist in a
given state, and resist or be resilient to small perturbations \cite{Filbee-Dexter2013}. 
Multiple stables states are possible. The idea that alternative
stable states may exist in community ecology was proposed in the late 1960s
\cite{Scheffer2001,Society2014a}.  May (1977) \cite{May1977} shown that an
ecosystem can be seen as a dynamic system where communities are not constant
over time and can change following a modification of the environnement.
Ecological communities can reach several equilibrium points or stable states
along an environmental gradient \cite{May1977}. Stable states can persist
according to various feedback mechanisms \cite{Filbee-Dexter2013}. For
instance, in the Sahel or some part of the Amazone area, vegetation may
promote precipitation (i.e. positive feedback) and thus the persistence of
large tracts of forests. However, loss of vegetation  in this region following
logging or natural fires can lead to a major change in climate, which because
eventually too dry to support the vegetation needed to maintain precipitations
\cite{scheffer2009critical}. Hence, larger perturbations encountered by the
system can generate a change of the state of a community, i.e. the arrangement
of species or populations and their interaction with the physical environment
\cite {Filbee-Dexter2013}.\\

Ecologists recognize three possible responses of communities to a permanent
change in the environment: \textbf{(A)} gradual, \textbf{(B)} basic fold,
\textbf{(C}) catastrophic fold \cite{Scheffer2001} (Figure \ref{fig1}, upper
line). First, when a small modification on environmental condition occurs
(e.g, temperature rises), the state of the community can change almost
linearly (Figure \ref{fig1}.A) \cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009}. In this case,
the whole ecosystem can be seen as a continuum of community along the
environmental gradient \cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009,scheffer2009critical}.
Secondly, the entire community can be insensitive to changing environmental
conditions over a certain range, but respond strongly when a threshold is
reached \cite{scheffer2009critical}. For instance, some species mortality can
increased sharply when a toxin is added to the environment and a lethal
treshold is reached \cite{scheffer2009critical}. In this case, the response
curve of this natural systeme is not linear but lightly folded. Hence, a small
change of the environment such adding a toxin, can lead to major changes in
the  community state. Lastly, in some strong non-linear systems, the response
can be folded backwards and alternative stable states could occur (Figure
\ref{fig1} .C). This implies that, for a given environnement, the ecosystem
has two alternative stable states ($F_1$ and $F_2$) separated by an unstable
equilibrium (yellow zone, figure \ref{fig1} .C). When the system approaches a
tipping point on the folded upper branch, it cannot pass smoothly to the lower
branch. Small forcing on initial conditions of the state $F_1$ transfers the
system immediately to a different state $F_2$ (Figure \ref{fig1} .C). At this
point, the system is particularly sensitive to the initial conditions. This
point is called a bifurcation point and a small forcing can drive the system
into backward or forward shifts towards either one of the alternative stable
states $F_1$ or $F_2$, also called "attractors" \cite{scheffer2009critical}.
The main ingredient to create alternative stable states is the occurrence of
positive feedbacks \cite{scheffer2009critical,Schroder2005}.One well known is
the facilitation process in ecology and two kinds exist in nature. The first
one is interspecific facilitation and can be observed across the ecological
succession process. Pioneer species pave the way for later successional
species, changing gradually the closest environment (e.g. shading, deeper
litter) \cite{scheffer2009critical, Levine2006}. In this case, the
environmental modification by pioneer species can be seen as a positive
feedback allowing the establishment of later successional species.  The second
kind of facilitation is intraspecific where a particular species can promote
her own regeneration in the immediate environment. Frelich (1993)
\cite{Society2014} hypothized that \textit{Acer saccharum} and \textit{Tsuga
canadensis} regenerations are related to the unique seedbed conditions created
by each species, to which conspecific seedlings are specialized. In changing
seebed condition, mature trees act as positive feedback to their own
regeneration. When the intraspecific facilitation is higher than the
interspecific competition, we can observed forest stand dominated by mature
trees of \textit{Acer saccharum} and else by \textit{Tsuga canadensis}. Hence,
either forest stand type can be considered as an alternative stable state.
This kind of positive feedback could be present in the the boreal-temperate
forests studied  \cite{Barras1998,Society2014}. \\

	where the system moves if not at the equilibrium (i.e outside of the solid lines). The yellow zone (in panel C),

\textbf{Natural system studied.} Many empirical and modelling studies have
been conducted on the transition between forest to non-forests communities
(e.g. Boreal-Tundra) \cite{Scheffer2012,Scheffer2001,Hirota2011,Messaoud2007}.
However, little attention has been given to understand the transition within
forest-forest ecotones \cite{Goldblum2010,Graignic2013,Messaoud2007}.  The
landscape at the temperate-boreal transition could adopt three different
structures along the climatic gradient (Figure \ref{fig1}, lower line).
Firstly, climate could act as the main factor explaining the distribution of
boreal and temperate communities. The response of forest communities to the
climate can be gradual and therefore no disctinct limits are observed between
the temperate and the boreal forests instead a smooth transition.


In the case of the boreal-temperate  forest transition, there is no distinct
boundary; instead a broad transition zone exists where stands dominated by
either coniferous or deciduous species co-occur
\cite{Goldblum2010,Fisichelli2013}.  We hypothesize them to be alternative
stable states and where a strong positive feedback contributes to the
maintenance of these communities. Coniferous delays temperate species
regeneration by generating specific soil conditions (i.e. acid and wetter
soils) favorable to their own establishment. On other hand, deciduous species
establishment can enrich the soil and promote their own regeneration. In this
context, we expect to find forest stands dominated by either boreal species or
temperate species. This system is particulary sensitivity to initial
conditions. 

 alternative stable states occurs in the
transition, then we expect to find a patchy mosaic structure (Figure
\ref{fig1} C.). Otherwise, the

%DG: la dernière phrase n'est pas claire, reformuler

% DG: ce n'est pas un feedback négatif, mais plutôt un positif où les résineux se favorisent eux-même.
%DG: dans l'ensemble, je trouve que cette section est plutôt légère en contenu. Je sais que tu en connais beaucoup plus, que tu as consulté abondamment la littérature. Mais pour l'instant, tu dis que tu t'attends à avoir des patches de différents états (rien de vraiment nouveau) et que ces états sont peut-être stables. Ensuite que c'est peut-être un feedback plante-sol. Rien de plus, dans un gros paragraphe. Tu peux en rajouter encore un peu. Par exemple, dire qu'un ASS est résistant à l'invasion; l'ERS ne peut envhair les patches de sapin, et l'inverse. parler un peu plus des mécanismes, des conséquences sur la vitesse de migration etc.. Du fait que l'ERS peut se maintenir en forêt boréale, même s'il est absent. 

\section{Methods}   

\textbf{State and Transitional Model.} This study will be based on a STM
representing landscape dynamics at the boreal-temperate transition. Three
forest cover types are considered: (i) deciduous, (ii) mixed and (iii)
coniferous \cite{Fisichelli2013}.  Each of these stand types is represented as
a state in the STM: \textbf{(D)} Deciduous, \textbf{(M)} Mixed, \textbf{(C)}
Coniferous. We also consider the state \textbf{(T)} to represent Transitional
stands (green circles, figure \ref{Model}).  According to Briske\textit{ et
al.} (2008) and this STM context, a state means a plant community phase
occurring on similar soils that interact with the environment to produce
persistent functional and structural attributes \cite{Briske2008}. Transition
between states are climate-dependant. Transitions between all states are
possible except the direct transition between a deciduous and coniferous
stand, which requires an intermediate step through state M. Except for the
colonization probability ($\theta$), transition probabilities vary with the
proportion of coniferous or deciduous found in the  neighbourhood to represent
dispersal limitations. For instance, the succession rate of a coniferous patch
($\beta_c$) towards a mixed patch (M) depends also on the availability of D
and M patches in the landscape (figure \ref{Model}).  \\

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.45\textwidth}
	\input{ fig/fig1.tex}
	\caption{Conceptual representation of the transition model between deciduous ($D$),
	mixed ($M$) and coniferous ($C$) stands. $T$ corresponds to a post-disturbance forest stand. Perturbations, natural and anthropogenic, occur with a probability $\epsilon$. 
	Flows or transition rates between states are represented by arrows.
	Parameters $\theta$ and $\beta$ are  colonization and succession probabilities,
	respectively. We define regeneration functions $\phi_c$ , $\phi_d$ as $\phi_c
	= \alpha_c \cdot (M+C) \cdot [1- \alpha_d \cdot (D+M)]$ and $\phi_d =
	\alpha_d \cdot (D+M) \cdot [1- \alpha_c \cdot (C+M)]$. $\phi_m$ include these both equations giving $\phi_m = \phi_c \cdot \phi_d$. Finally, parameter $\alpha$ represents the climate-dependent regeneration rate after a patch has been disturbed.}
	\label{Model}
	\vspace{1em}
\end{wrapfigure}

Ecological processes
such as succession and colonization are not the only mecanisms responsible for
the transition between two states. Natural disturbances are an important
drivers of forest dynamics at the landscape scale (e.g. fire in boreal forest
or large windthrow in temperate forest). Small fires promote dominance by
deciduous species, while larger and intense fires favour boreal communities
\cite{Bergeron2004}. Anthropogenic disturbances such as logging can also
produce major change in the forest composition. Dupuis \textit{et al.} (2011)
revealed that historical disturbances affected the  expansion (maples/aspen)
or decline (cedar/spruce) of several species at the northern range limit of
temperate trees in eastern Québec \cite{Dupuis2011}. When a disturbance occurs
in the actual model, state affected is systematically converted into a
transitional state \textbf{(T)}. (Figure \ref{Model}).  Thereafter, any
transitional patch (\textbf{T}) can be transferred into state C, M or D
following a function of probability $\phi$. In the conversion case of state T
towards C, this flow $\phi_c$ incorporates a specific patch regeneration rate
($\alpha_c$), as well as the availability of coniferous $(C + M)$ species and
the proportion of patches unconverted into a deciduous state, $1- \alpha_d
\cdot (D + M)$ (see caption, figure \ref{Model}). If this patch $C$ is
undisturbed, then it could switch to a mixed stand after colonization by
deciduous trees with a probability $\theta_c$. The dynamics of this model can
be described with a system of four differential equations.  The dynamics of
$T$ over the time is described by the following differential equation:

\begin{equation}
 	\frac{\delta T}{\delta t} =\epsilon \cdot (C+M+D) - T \cdot (\phi_d + \phi_c + \phi_m)
\end{equation}

The differential equations illustrating the dynamics of the other three states
(C, M and D) in the system are relatively similar and can be described (with
coniferous state as example):

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\delta C}{\delta t} = \phi_c \cdot T + \theta_c \cdot M -\alpha_d \cdot (D+M)\cdot C - \epsilon \cdot C
\end{equation}

This model is spatially implicit and assumes that each patch is occupied by
one state, thus the proportion of all states sum to 1 in the entire matrix
landscape. \\

\textbf{Data description.} The parameterization and validation of the model
will be conducted using the QUICC- FOR\footnote{Quantifying and mapping impact
of climate change on the forest productivity in eastern Canada.} database
containing large permanent (PP) and temporary (TP) sample plots from United
States and Canada. The data has been freely provided by partners and covers 3
eastern Canadian provinces (\textit{ca.} 16,000 plots) and 31 states of
eastern USA (\textit{ca.} 150,000 plots). Surveys started in the 1970s and
include up to 5 remeasurements, with the interval between sampling ranging
from 5 to 10 years. Data is recorded for seedlings, trees, saplings and stand
level. Stem-level information includes diameter at breast height (DBH),
species, state of the stem (e. g. alive or dead), height, age and canopy
position. Seedling and sapling data provide numbers of individuals by class of
DBH and species. The stand-level data includes relevant information about soil
deposit, drainage, disturbances, cover type and age and height of the stand.
All  inventories are geo-referenced. Climatic variables are associated to each
plot by interpolating  the climatic model ANUSPLIN \cite{McKenney2011} . We
will parameterize the model using annual rainfall (mm) and monthly
temperatures (minimum, maximum and average in \ensuremath{^\circ}C) of the 30
years previous to the year of each plot's sampling. Those variables are used
by many authors as good predictors of the distribution of the species
investigated in this present study \cite{Goldblum2010}. Filters will be
applied to the database prior to the model parameterization. As a first step,
out of the 57 species contained in the database, only 28 representative
species of the whole sample plots network will be taken into account. Only
plots with mesic soil conditions, \textit{i.e.}, thick deposits with fast to
moderate drainage, will be considered for the analysis. We will consider only
mature stands with dominant strata containing trees greater than 50 years old.
Lastly, plots disturbed by human activities (mostly by logging) will be
removed in order to parametrize the model using only natural disturbances. \\

\textbf{Parametrization.} The model focuses on representative species of the
boreal and temperate forest. Relative  abundance of each species will be
computed from basal area in each of the plots and at each time step (year of
measurement). Stands will be considered in one of the four states previously
described in the model's section (Figure \ref{Model}). C, M, D and T states
will be classified following their percentage of $Ba$ in deciduous ($Ba_d$),
coniferous ($Ba_c$) or transition species ($Ba_t$) in the plot (Table
\ref{bound}). The plots that do not satisfy any of the conditions shown in
table \ref{bound} are filtered out.\\

\begin{table}[h]
\vspace{-1em}
\centering
\caption{Boundary of the coniferous ($Ba_c$), deciduous ($Ba_d$) and transition species ($Ba_t$) relative abundances to classify the four STM's states (D,C,M and T). The symbol ($!$) means that the forest plot hasn't been previously classified into one of the states C, D or M.}
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	States  & Boundaries                            \\
	\hline
	D & $Ba_c< 25\%$ and $Ba_d \geq 75\%$    \\
	C & $Ba_c \geq 75\%$ and $Ba_d < 25\%$    \\
	M & $Ba_c \geq 25\%$ and $Ba_d \geq 25\%$ \\
	T & $!D;!C;!M \text{ and }  Ba_t  \geq 75\%$ \\
	\hline                               
\end{tabular}

\label{bound}
\end{table}

The second step of the parameterization consists of evaluating functions
describing the probability of a transition between two states given specific
climatic conditions ($Climate$, eq. \ref{eq1}) and the proportion of deciduous
or coniferous in the neighborhood ($\hat{D}$ and $\hat{M}$, eq. \ref{eq1}).
Hereafter, will focus only on a specific transition $M \rightarrow T$ but the
method is common to represent  all transitions. In this example (eq.
\ref{eq1}),  $\hat{D}$ and $\hat{M}$ are the expected probabilities of
observing state D or M in this area given climatic conditions. They are proxy
for the deciduous propagule pressure coming from neighbors. They will be
estimated using  a standard species distribution model (Step 1, eq. \ref{eq1})
auch as the random forest algorithm (R-package, \cite{Liaw2002a}).

\begin{equation}
	P(D_{t1}|M_{t0}, Climate) = f(\overbrace{Climate, \underbrace{\hat{D}, \hat{M}}_\text{Step 1. RandomForest}}^\text{ Step 2. Multinomial regression})
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}

The probability of a transition between two states given the local climatic
conditions encounter by a patch (Step 2, eq. \ref{eq1}) will be computed using a multinomial
regression (nnet R-package, \cite{Venables2002}). We can summarize this
multinomial regression as $P(D_{t1}|M_{t0}) \sim \hat{D} + \hat{M} +
X_1+X_2+X_i... $ where $\hat{D}$ and $\hat{M}$ correspond to the probability
of observing any state in the immediate neighbourhood (previously presented)
and $X_i$ a climate variable. Model selection will be performed using Akaike's
information criterion (AIC). Model selected will be used to represent all
flows between states.   \\

\textbf{Model validation and simulations.}  The model will be validated using
the temporary sample plots (TP), an independent dataset present only in the
Québec database. Temporary plots will be classified into the same four states.
We will compute the proportion of each state by ecoregion ("\textit{Système de
classification des types écologiques}", MRN) and compare this distribution
than predicted by the model.  Highest R-squared and lowest Akaike information
criterion (AIC) will be associated with the best predictive and parsimonious
model. Bias (i.e low R-squared) might indicate that the current forest
composition is not at equilibrium and needing further investigations. After
the validation, we will assess if alternative stable states are present in the
boreal-temperate forests transitions ($H_1$). We will run multiple simulations
of the spatially implicit model in varying initial conditions i.e. states
proportion and climate conditions. In studying the simulations, we expect to
find abrupt changes in states proportion over the time. Also, we expect to
oberved bimodal distributions of states over a certain range of climate
conditions (when the model is at the equilibrium). If these expectations are
validated then alternative stable states are present in the boreal- temperate
forests system.  In this implicit model, rates of transition depend to the
proportion of states available in the general system, thus rates of transition
are unconditional to the state of patches in the neighborhood. This property
of the model makes it impossible to assess sugar maple range schift (i.e.
dispersal and velocity rates of forest temperate patches) as proposed through
hypothesis $H_2$. To remedy it, we will embed this model into cellular
automaton where each cell corresponds to a forest patch in the landscape and
more specificaly a state (C,D,M or T). The succession ($\beta$), regeneration
($\alpha$) probabilities of a patch will be positively affected by the
presence of states in its eight neighboring cells.  With this explicit model,
we will run simulations and modulate climate in the lattice (e.g. rise the
temperature). We expect to observed a rate of sugar maple migration strongly
delayed or mitigated   where the alternative stable states appear.
