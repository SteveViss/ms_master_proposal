\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Context.} Sugar maple (\textit{Acer saccharum}) is a widespread and
abundant tree species in north-eastern North America.
\cite{Graignic2013,Messaoud2007,Kellman2004,Barras1998}. Predicting shifts in
the range of Sugar maple is of prime importance because this species is highly
desirable for hardwood and maple syrup production, two large economic sectors
in Quebec. This species is dominating the temperate forest up to the boreal-
temperate ecotone at its northern range limit \cite{Barras1998}. Some
representative species of northern forest ecosystems are expected to expand
their distribution towards the north following climate warming
\cite{Sciences2014,Iverson2002}. According to McKenney (2007)
\cite{Sciences2014}, the climatic conditions  favorable to Sugar maple  will
reach the Ungava bay within the next 100 years, which appears highly
improbable because of dispersal limitations and slow population dynamics.
Such predictions are built on species distribution models accounting only for
climatic conditions; it is recognized that Sugar maple regeneration depends
both on macro  (\textit{i.e.} regional climate) and micro environmental
conditions (\textit{i.e.} soil and microtopography)
\cite{Graignic2013,Lafleur2010}. Thus, the expansion of Sugar maple and iis
difficult to predict because micro conditions can mitigate macro conditions
such as global warming \cite{DeFrenne2013}.\\ 
%DG: la dernière phrase n'est pas claire, je n'ai pas réussi à l'éditer comme la précédente.

Soil-plant feedbacks are susceptible to impact Sugar maple migration dynamics.
Tree species respond differently to the soil conditions, and the soil
properties found in boreal forests are different from those in temperate
forest \cite{Lafleur2010,Barras1998,Goldblum2010,Demers1998}. A deep and
poorly-decomposed litter layer is usually found in boreal forests, while the
litter of  northern hardwood forests is thinner and mainly composerd of a
superficial leaf mat \cite{Barras1998}. The temperature is colder, the snow
melts later and the soil is wetter under coniforous trees
\cite{Lafleur2010,Goldblum2010}. Soil acidification causes a reduction in the
cation exchange capacity and subsequently decreases availability of some
nutrients such as calcium \cite{Moore2008}. Sugar maple seedlings have been
recognized to be particularly sensitive to waterlogged conditions and soil
nutrient content \cite{Moore2008,Lafleur2010,Cleavitt2011}. These properties
of coniferous forest soils could hinder the local establishment of species
associated with alkaline soils or unable to withstand waterlogged conditions
\cite{Lafleur2010}. Under these conditions, tree species migration is likely
to be restricted or delayed \cite{Lafleur2010}. Thus, even if the climatic
conditions at the regional scale become favorable to Sugar maple after climate
warming, the micro conditions found in the boreal forest could slow seedling
establishment \cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008,Barras1998,Messier2011}.Sugar maple
could thus be unable to colonize the boreal forests as a result of strong and
localized plant-soil feedbacks \cite{McCarthyNeumann2012}.\\

I hypothesize that the temperate-boreal forest ecotone is as a system
dominated by two alternative states, \textit{i.e.} contrasted states occurring
in the same climate conditions \cite{scheffer2009critical}: the boreal
community and the temperate community, including Sugar maple. The landscape is
made of a patch mosaic where micro conditions are driving the spatial
occurrence of boreal and temperate communities, despite a regional climate
favourable to temperate species \cite{Goldblum2010,Fisichelli2013}. I expect
that a climate warming and the subsequent incapacity of Sugar maple to
colonize boreal forest stands will create  tension between the potential and
realized forest composition and consequently that abrupt shifts in community
composition are susceptible to occur at the boreal-temperate forest ecotone.\\


\textbf{Objectives.} The main objective of this project is to investigate the
transition between the boreal and temperate forests under different climate
change scenarios. In this context, we will test two different hypotheses:
($H_1$) Alternative stable states do co-occur at the boreal-temperate forests
ecotone, and ($H_2$) the response of Sugar maple to climate change will be
delayed in  in areas where alternative stable states are susceptible to occur.
In order to fulfill this objective and test these hypotheses, we will (1)
develop a climate-dependent  state-transition model (STM) representing the
dynamics of the boreal and temperate communities at landscape scale; (2) study
the occurrence of alternative stable states at the temperate-boreal ecotone;
and finally (3) run simulations of the temperate community species
distribution under different climate change scenarios. The first section of
this proposal reviews the context of the study. The first part of the review
presents the concept of alternative stable states and critical transitions in
forest ecosystem properties. The second part focuses on Sugar maple, its
associated community in the temperate biome, and a justification about why
alternative stable states are expected to occur at the boreal-temperate
forests ecotone. The last section of this proposal describes the model and the
methodology that we will employ to achieve the specific objectives.

\textbf{Alternative stable states in forest ecosystems.} The idea that
alternative stable states may exist in community ecology was proposed in the
late 1960s \cite{Scheffer2001,Society2014a}.  May (1977) \cite{May1977}
highlighted the fact than an ecosystem can be seen as a dynamic system where
communities are not constant accross the time and can change following
environnemental changes. These communities can reached several equilibrium
points or stable states along an environmental gradient \cite{May1977}.   A
community is  stable when it persist in a given state, and resist or be
resilient to small perturbations \cite{Filbee-Dexter2013}.    The community
can persist according to various feedback mechanisms \cite{Filbee-Dexter2013}.
For instance, in the Sahel or some part of the Amazone area, vegetation may
promote precipitation (i.e. positive feedback). However, loss of vegetation in
this region can lead to climate that is too dry to support the vegetation
needed to keep up the precipitation \cite{scheffer2009critical}. Hence, larger
perturbations encountered by the system can generate changes on state of a
community, i.e. the arrangement of species or populations and their
interaction with the physical environment \cite {Filbee-Dexter2013}. There are
three possible community responses following these perturbations: \textbf{(A)}
gradual, \textbf{(B)} basic fold, \textbf{(C}) catastrophic fold
\cite{Scheffer2001} (Figure \ref{fig1}, upper line). First, when a small
modification environmental occurs, the state of the community can change
almost linearly (Figure \ref{fig1}.a, upper line)
\cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009}. In this case, the whole ecosystem can be
seen as a continuum of community along the climate gradient
\cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009,scheffer2009critical}. Secondly, the entire
community can be insensitive to changing environmental conditions over a
certain range, but respond strongly when a threshold is reached
\cite{scheffer2009critical}. For instance, some species mortality can
increased sharply when a toxin is added to the environment and a lethal
treshold is reached \cite{scheffer2009critical}. In this case, the response
curve of this natural systeme is not linear but lightly folded . Hence,  small
perturbations such adding toxin can lead to major changes in the species
communities. Lastly, in some strong non-linear systems, the response curve can
be folded backwards and alternative stable states could occur (Figure
\ref{fig1} .C).  This implies that, for a certain environnemental conditions,
the ecosystem has two alternative stable states ($F_1$ and $F_2$) separated by
un unstable equilibriums (yellow zone, figure \ref{fig1} .C). When the system
approaches a tipping point on the folded upper branch, it cannot pass smoothly
to the lower branch. Small forcing on initial conditions of the state $F_1$
transfer the system immediately into a different state $F_2$ (Figure
\ref{fig1} .C). Hence, at this point, the system is particularly sensitive to
the initial conditions. This point is called a bifurcation point and a small
forcing on it can drive the system into backward or forward shifts towards
either alternative stable states also called "attractors"
\cite{scheffer2009critical}. The main ingredient to create alternative
stable states is the occurrence of positive feedbacks
\cite{scheffer2009critical,Schroder2005}.

One well known is
facilitation in ecological succession (i.e. the idea that pioneer species pave
the way for later successional species).

 this feedback seems to be present in the the
boreal-temperate forests studied \cite{Barras1998,Society2014}. \\

\textbf{Natural system studied.} Many empirical and modelling studies have
been conducted on the transition between forest to non-forests communities
(e.g. Boreal-Tundra) \cite{Scheffer2012,Scheffer2001,Hirota2011,Messaoud2007}.
Little attention has been given to understand forest-forest ecotones
\cite{Goldblum2010,Graignic2013,Messaoud2007}.  In the case of the boreal-
temperate  forests, there is no distinct boundary; instead a broad transition
zone exists where stands of coniferous and deciduous species co-occur
\cite{Goldblum2010,Fisichelli2013}. Within this ecotone, we expect to find
alternative stable states at landscape scale. 

In fact, the temperate-boreal
forest possess a patchiness structure. This structure is often attributed to
differences in soils, nutrient status and topographical factors
\cite{Society2014}.

%Tu commences par dire que tu t'attends à des
%stades stables alternatifs en raison de l'écologie des espèces tempérées et
%boréales. Là tu listes tous les faits.

A positive feedback contributes to the maintenance of the community type if
the dominant tree species promotes conditions facilitating its own
regeneration \cite{Barras1998}. Frelich \textit{et al.}(1993)
\cite{Society2014} hypothesized such a soil-plant feedback impacts Sugar maple
and hemlock spatial distribution. Hence, soil conditions and role of dominant
species in regeneration seems to act as main feedbacks on the temperate forest
establishment (Figure \ref{fig1}.c, upper panel). Boreal soil can delay
temperate species regeneration (negative feedback) and, on other hand,
temperate species establishment can enrich the soil so they promote their own
regeneration (positive feedback).

%DG: attention, l'effet des espèces boréales est aussi un feedback positif:
%plus il y a de sapin, plus la régénération de sapin est favorisée

In this context, we expect to find forest stands dominated by either boreal
species or temperate species and sensitivity to initial conditions. Thus, the
soil condition and the role of dominant species in boreal and temperate
forests need to be investigate as main drivers in shifts between alternative
stable states \cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008,DeFrenne2013,Barras1998}.

\textbf{State and Transitional Model.} The framework of this study lies is a
STM representing dynamics in the boreal-temperate forest transition at the
landscape scale.  Overall, the ecotone landscape includes three distinctive
kind of forest canopies: (i) deciduous, (ii) mixed and finally (iii)
coniferous \cite{Fisichelli2013}.  Each of these stand types is represented as
a state in the STM: \textbf{(D)} Deciduous, \textbf{(M)} Mixed, \textbf{(C)}
Coniferous and finally we added \textbf{(T)} a Transitional patch detailled
later in the paragraph (green circles, figure \ref{Model}).  According to
Briske\textit{ et al.} (2008) and this STM context, state means a plant
community phase occurring on similar soils that interact with the environment
to produce persistent functional and structural attributes \cite{Briske2008}.
Each transition rates between states are  are climate-dependant. Transitions
between all states are possible except the direct transition between a
deciduous and coniferous stand, which requires an intermediate step through
state M. Except for the colonization rate ($\theta$), transition rates vary
with the proportion of coniferous or deciduous available in the closest
neighbourhood. For instance, the succession rate of a coniferous patch
($\beta_c$) towards a mixed patch (M) depends also on the availability of D
and M patches in the landscape (figure \ref{Model}).  Natural processes such
succession and colonization are not the only mecanisms leading the transition
between two states. In fact, natural disturbances are an important driver of
forest dynamics at landscape scale (e.g. fire in boreal forest or large
windthrow in temperate forest). For instance, small fires induce deciduous
dominance and larger and intense fires favouring boreal communities
\cite{Bergeron2004}. Anthropogenic disturbances such as logging can also
produce major change in the forest composition. Dupuis \textit{et al.} (2011)
revealed that historical disturbances affected the propensity of taxa to
expand (maples/aspen) or decline (cedar/spruce) in the northern hardwood range
limit in eastern Québec \cite{Dupuis2011}. Thus, a state is systematically
converted into a transitional patch \textbf{(T)} when one of those
disturbances event occur at rate $\epsilon$ (Figure \ref{Model}). After a
perturbation, a patch T with can be recovered to state C, M or D following a
function $\phi$. For instance when a patch T is recovered into a patch C, this
flow described by the function $\phi_c$ incorporates a specific patch recovery
rate ($\alpha_c$), as well as the availability of coniferous $(C + M)$ species
and the proportion of patches unconverted into a deciduous state, $1- \alpha_d
\cdot (D + M)$ (see caption, figure \ref{Model}). If this patch $C$ is
undisturbed, then the coniferous stand turns into a mixed stand by deciduous
colonization with a rate $\theta_c$. The  overall dynamic of this model can be
summarize through four differential equations. The dynamics of $T$ over the
time is described by this differential equation: $\frac{\delta T}{\delta t} =
\epsilon \cdot (C+M+D) - T \cdot (\phi_d + \phi_c + \phi_m)$. The differential
equations illustrating the dynamics of the other three states (C,M and D) in
the system are relatively similar and can be described (with coniferous state
as example): $\frac{\delta C}{\delta t} = \phi_c \cdot T + \theta_c \cdot M -
\alpha_d \cdot (D+M)\cdot C - \epsilon \cdot C$. The entire model is spatially
implicit and assumes that each patch is occupied by one state, thus the
proportion of all states sum to 1 in the entire matrix landscape. \\

\textbf{Data description.} The parameterization and validation of the model
will be conducted using the QUICC- FOR\footnote{Quantifying and mapping impact
of climate change on the forest productivity in eastern Canada.} database
containing large permanent (PP) and temporary (TP) sample plots from United
States and Canada. The data have been freely provided by partners and covers 3
eastern Canadian provinces (\textit{ca.} 16,000 plots) and 31 states of
eastern USA (\textit{ca.} 50,000 plots). Surveys started in the 1970s and
include up to 5 remeasurements, with the interval between sampling ranging
from 5 to 10 years. Data is recorded for seedlings, trees, saplings and stand
level. Stem-level information includes diameter at breast height (DBH),
species, state of the stem (e. g. alive or dead), height, age and canopy
position. Seedling and sapling data provide numbers of individuals by class of
DBH and species. The stand-level data includes relevant information about
soil deposit, drainage, disturbances, cover type and age and height of the
stand. All plot inventories are geo-referenced. For each plot location, some
climatic variables extracted by interpolation from the climatic
model ANUSPLIN \cite{McKenney2011} are included. We will parameterize the model using
annual rainfall (mm) and monthly temperatures (minimum, maximum and average in
\ensuremath{^\circ}C) of the 30 years previous to the year of each plot's sampling.
Those variables are used by many authors as external conditions to detect
alternative stable states and are often indicative of the distribution of
biomes investigated in this present study
\cite{Goldblum2010,Hirota2011,Scheffer2012}. Filters will also be applied to the
database prior to the model parameterization. As a first step, out of the 57
species contained in the database, only 28 representative species of the
whole sample plots network will be taken into account. Only plots with mesic
soil conditions, \textit{i.e.}, thick deposits with fast to moderate drainage,
will be considered for the analysis. We will consider only mature stands
with dominant strata containing trees greater than 50 years old. Lastly, plots
disturbed by human activities (mostly by logging) will be removed in order to
parametrize the model using only natural disturbances. \\


\textbf{Parametrization.} As previously stated, the model focuses mostly on
representative species of the boreal and temperate forest. The basal area
($m^2/ha$, $Ba$) will be computed to provide a measure of relative species
abundance in each of the plots and at each time step (year of measurement).
Stands will be considered in one of the four states previously described in
the model's section (Figure \ref{Model}). C, M and D states will be classified
following their percentage of $Ba$ in deciduous ($Ba_d$) and coniferous ($Ba_c$)
species in the plot (Table \ref{bound}). 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Boundary of the coniferous and deciduous basal area used in order to classified the four STM's states. The symbole ($!$) means that we don't take in account states already classified}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
	States  & Boundaries                            \\
	\hline
	\textbf{D} & $Ba_c< 25\%$ and $Ba_d \geq 75\%$    \\
	\textbf{C} & $Ba_c \geq 75\%$ and $Ba_d < 25\%$    \\
	\textbf{M} & $Ba_c \geq 25\%$ and $Ba_d \geq 25\%$ \\
	\textbf{T} & $!D;!C;!M \text{ and }  Ba_t  \geq 75\%$                                
\end{tabular}

\label{bound}
\end{table}

The rest of the plots are unclassified if they have unsatisfied the conditions
shown in table \ref{bound}. The second step consists of computing a
probability function of transition between two states given a specific climate
condition ($Climate$, eq. \ref{eq1}) and proportion of deciduous or coniferous
available ($\hat{D}$ and $\hat{M}$, eq. \ref{eq1}).  Hereafter, will focus
only on a specific transition $M \rightarrow T$ but the method used will be
generalized on all transitions.  In this example (eq. \ref{eq1}),  $\hat{D}$
and $\hat{M}$ are the expected probability of observing state D or M in this
area given climatic conditions. They are proxy for the deciduous regeneration
pressure surrounding the area. They will be estimated using  a classification
method (Step 1, eq. \ref{eq1}) as for instance random forest (R-package,
\cite{Liaw2002a}).

\begin{equation}
	P(D_{t1}|M_{t0}, Climate) = f(\overbrace{Climate, \underbrace{\hat{D}, \hat{M}}_\text{Step 1. RandomForest}}^\text{ Step 2. Multinomial regression})
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}


To compute the probability of state occurrence given the local climatic
conditions encounter by a patch (Step 2, eq. \ref{eq1}), we use a multinomial
regression (nnet R-package, \cite{Venables2002}). We can summarize this
multinomial regression as $P(D_{t1}|M_{t0}) \sim \hat{D} + \hat{M} +
X_1+X_2+X_i... $ where $\hat{D}$ and $\hat{M}$ correspond to the probability
of observing any state in the immediate neighbourhood (previously presented)
and $X_i$ a climate variable. Model selection will be performed using Akaike's
information criterion (AIC). Model selected will serve to parameterize all
flows between states in order to determine a transition matrix that will be a
function of the external conditions (i.e. neighbourhood and climate).   \\

\textbf{Model simulations.} 

To validate the model, we will use the temporary plots (TP), an independent
dataset present only in the Québec database. Temporary plots will be
classified into the same four states. We will compute the proportion of each
state by ecoregion ("\textit{Système de classification des types
écologiques}", MRN). Secondly, we will run the model at equilibrium predicting
the state proportions in same ecoregions and compare them with observed data
from TP database. Highest R-squared and lowest Akaike information criterion
(AIC) will be associated with the best predictive and parsimonious model. Bias
(i.e low R-squared) might indicate that the current forest composition is not
at equilibrium and needing further investigations. After the validation, we
will assess if alternative stable states are present in the boreal-temperate
forests transitions ($H_1$). In running the model at the equilibrium, (i)  we
expect to find abrupt state transitions over the time; (ii) biomodal state
frequency distribution (states $D$ and $C$).
 

After the validation process, we will study equilibrium states of the model
and investigate the first hypothesis by (i) evaluate the model sensitivity on
initials conditions (e.g state occurrences), (ii) analyze the spatial
structure of the landscape (e.g. mosaic) for presence of alternatives stables
states. 

%The last part consists of implementing the model as a spatially explicit cellular
%automaton.

Lastly, we will run simulations with increases or modification of the
climatic gradient in the cellular automaton. This step, in the context of the
second hypothesis, allows us to assess Sugar maple migration (e.g velocity and
time lag) through  temperate communities under different climate change
scenarios.
