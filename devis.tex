\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Context.}  The boreal region is warming twice as fast as the global
average and  this will inevitably alter the species composition in boreal
forests \cite{Scheffer2012,Hughes2000}.  Sugar maple (\textit{Acer saccharum})
is one of the species expected to migrate northward towards the northern limit
of the temperate forest \cite{McKENNEY2007,Goldblum2005}. Predicting shifts in
the range of sugar maple under climate change is an important challenge
because this species is highly desirable by hardwood and maple syrup
producers, two large economic sectors in Quebec. Indeed, sugar maple is a
widespread and abundant tree in north-eastern North America and is one of the
most representative species of northern temperate forests
\cite{Graignic2013,Messaoud2007,Kellman2004,Barras1998}. The expected
northward migration of sugar maple and its vegetal community during climate
change will increase the ecotone between the boreal and temperate forest of
Quebec. Nevertheless, the expansion of species distribution occuring in Nordic
temperate forest could be difficult to predict because microclimatic
conditions found in boreal forests are different from those present in
temperate forest. Colder temperatures from shading and excess soil moisture
due to snow melt cause litter to be more acidic and fibrous during the spring
in boreal forests . Therefore, even if the regional climate conditions are
favorable \cite{Kellman2004}, the microbiota and microclimatic conditions
found in the boreal forest could affect the establishment of sugar maple
\cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008,DeFrenne2013,Barras1998}. In this case, the sugar
maple could be unable to migrate in boreal forests as a result of negative
local conditions feedbacks. This phenomenon could increase the tension between
the boreal and temperate forest and generate abrupt changes in the community
composition and generating a patchy mosaic at landscape scale
(\textbf{$H_0$}).\\

\textbf{Objectives.} This project aims to develop a state and transition model
(STM) of the boreal and temperate forests in order to investigate shifts in the
distribution of sugar maple into the boreal-temperate forest dynamical
system.To assess this main objective, I will (1) create a  model of the
transition between the temperate and the boreal forest; (2) investigate the
spatial structure and presence of alternative stable states in the transitional
zone; and finally (3) run simulations based on different climate change
scenarios.  In order to define the context of this study, the first section of
this project proposal is a review subdivided into two parts. The first part
presents the theoretical context on alternative stable states and abrupt changes
in ecosystems functioning. The second part of this review focuses on the sugar
maple , its community and co-existing species in the temperate forest and thus
explain why alternative stable states is a relevant framework to study the
dynamic of the boreal-temperate forests ecotone.  The second section of this
document describes the model and the methodology employed to assess the
objectives. To conclude, the last part presents the general timeline associated
with this project.

% Comments from Hedvig on theoretical framework section: This first part of the review is nice and well explained, but isn’t the theoretical framework, it’s about the forest… But I think it’s better to describe ASS while you talk about forests, to make it clear. Just change the title to ‘ASS in forests’ or something

\textbf{Alternative stable state in forest ecosystems.}  Many ecotone studies
and modeling efforts on transition between forest to non-forests (e. g. Boreal
- Tundra) \cite{Scheffer2012,Scheffer2001,Hirota2011,Messaoud2007} but little
attention has been given to evaluate the transitional dynamics of forest-
forest ecotones \cite{Goldblum2010,Graignic2013}. At large scale, transition
between  the temperate and boreal forests can be approach as a dynamic system
where each forest biomes is a stable state. The presence of different states
at a location or a time depends on environmental conditions (e. g. soil,
temperature) encountered by the system. When small environmental fluctuations
occur, most dynamical system responds almost linearly with no threshold to
drastic changes in the state of the ecosystem ( Figure \ref{fig1} .a)
\cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009}. In this case, only one equilibrium can be
observed given a specific environmental condition
\cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009,scheffer2009critical}.  When the soil moisture
increase slowly, the new condition obtained might cause favorable conditions
to a new species but this species establishment doesn't affect the community,
thus the ecosystem functionning. Another kind of response occurs more
frequently in nature.  Natural systems are insensitive to environmental
conditions over certain ranges but respond strongly when a threshold is
reached (Figure \ref{fig1} .b) \cite{scheffer2009critical}. Tree mortality can
increase sharply when a toxin is added to the environment.
\cite{scheffer2009critical}. In this case, the response curve of the natural
systeme is not linear but lightly folded and a small change can drive the
sytem to a treshold and lead to major changes. Small changes in the initial
conditions can transform abruptly the species community composition and lead
to a strong spatial division as representing in figure \ref{fig1}.c (Upper
panel). In an other hand, respond curve can be folded backwards and the same
threshold can conduct the system into catastrophic changes (Figure \ref{fig1}
.c).  When the system approach a tipping point on the folded upper branch, the
system cannot pass smootly to the lower branch. Small forcing on initial
condition of the state $F_1$ transfer immediatly the system into a contrasted
state $F_2$ (Figure \ref{fig1} .c). This point is called \textit{Bifurcation
point} and small forcing on those critical states can drive the system into
backward or forward shifts, increasing catastrophic events. In this situation,
the system present alternative stable states who mean the presence of
contrasted states over certain range of environmental conditions
\cite{scheffer2009critical}. This range can be spatially structured as an
intermixed of constrasted patches in a ecotone landscape like shown across the
sub-figure \ref{fig1} .c (upper part). This layout could be easily rattached
to the hardwood-boreal forest patchiness structure often attribute to
differences in soils, nutrient status and topographical factors
\cite{Society2014}.\\

\textbf{Natural system.} In the boreal-temperate forest ecotone, there is no
distinct boundary and a broad transition zone exists composed of mixed stands
of coniferous-deciduous species \cite{Goldblum2010}. Instead a macromosaic
landscape can be observed with pure stands of deciduous trees on favorable
sites and pure coniferous stands on less favorable sites \cite{Goldblum2010}.
This segregated patches distribution could be explain by the fact than
microclimatic conditions can modulate at large scale, and on long term,
establishement of those forest community's species \cite{DeFrenne2013}.
Distribution of deciduous and boreal forests within ecotone is not determined
only along environnemental gradients present on large scales but rather by
local variation and conditions in substrate, drainage, physical soil
properties, and nutrient avaiblity \cite{Goldblum2010,Society2014}.  By
example, balsam fir (\textit{Abies balsamea}) is often related to thick
organic horizons and coarse xeric deposits while sugar maple is mostly present
in opposite edaphic conditions \cite{Messaoud2007,Kellman2004,Barras1998}.
Moreover, boreal and hardwood forests are dominated by trees of distinctive
physiognomy which may be expected to produce distinctive litter and light
micro-environments \cite{Barras1998}. Those dominant species might induce
conditions that differentially facilitate regeneration of the of the
community’s species as positive feeback which contribute to preserve the
community type \cite{Barras1998}. Frelich \textit{et al.}(1993)
\cite{Society2014} hypothesized sugar maple has one of those species.  Knowing
this, the alternative stable states is a relevant framework to study this
ecotone dynamic because the soil conditions and role of dominant species in
regeneration seems to act as main feedbacks on the temperate forest
establishment generating a patchiness landscape (Figure \ref{fig1}.c, upper
panel). In this context, we expected to find patch dominated by boreal species
and others dominated by temperate species under a certain range of climatic
conditions. Thus, the soil condition and the role of dominant species in
boreal and temperate forest need to be investigate as main drivers in
alternative stable states
\cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008,DeFrenne2013,Barras1998}.


% We used maple sugar basa areal in function of black
% spruce, white spruce and balsam fir basal area to compute the relative
% abundance of sugar maple. Given the above statements, we used mainly two
% climatic variables (annual mean temperature and annual precipitation) to
% identify the alternative stable states present in the boreal-temperate
% ecotone. The relationship was performed on climatic variables and sugar maple
% relative abundance using kernel density plot function. We obtained the
% probability of observed a sample plot as function of sugar maple relative
% abundance and mean annual temperature (Figure \ref{fig1}). In both case,
% alternative stable states are presents whereas the function graphed has a
% bimodal distribution. At low precipitation or temperature conditions, the
% probability of observing a parcel sampled without sugar maple is higher than
% intermediate climatic conditions where the multimodal distribution appear. The
% density function suggest the presence of alternative stabe states  in response
% of intermediate climatic conditions: one state wherein sugar maple dominates
% and an another in which sugar maple is absent. \\

\section{Methods}   

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.45\textwidth}

	\caption{Conceptual transition model between forest stands deciduous ($D$),
	mixte ($M$) and coniferous ($C$). $T$ corresponds to a transitionnal state
	where a perturbation are occurred with a frequence of $e$. Parameters $\beta$
	and $S$ are referred as the colonisation and the succession rates
	respectively. We defined the recovery rates ($\phi_c$ et $\phi_d$) as $\phi_c
	= \alpha_c \cdot (M+C) \cdot [1- \alpha_d \cdot (D +M)]$ and $\phi_D =
	\alpha_d \cdot (D+M) \cdot [1- \alpha_c \cdot (C +M)]$, to finaly get this
	equation $\phi_m = \phi_c \cdot \phi_d$. The parameter $\alpha$ mean the
	recovery rate after a patch has been disturbe.}         
	\label{Model}
\end{wrapfigure}


Following this review, the first methodology section will describe the general
model reproducing the boreal-temperate ecotone dynamic. The second part will
be adressed on data used on the parametrization and calibration of this model.
Whereas the transition between temperate and boreal forests is influenced by
environnemental conditions and proportion of coniferious and deciduous
available in the neighbourhood, the third section section will dedicated on
those factors and their parametrization. Two last sections will focus on
simulation and validations techniques used in this project's context.\\

\textbf{Models.} This state and transition model will be based on three
different forest states: \textbf{(D)} Deciduous and \textbf{(M)} Mixed patches
characterizing temperate forests, then \textbf{(C)} Coniferous patch
representing boreal forests (Figure \ref{Model}). Disturbances regime is a main
driver in those forest dynamics (e .g. Fire in boreal forest or frost in
temperate forest). When gap event occur in deciduous patch, species presents
will be replaced by shade intolerant species as aspen and white birch, well
adapted to the new shading condition. Thus post-disturbance patches has been
integrated within the model across the transitional patch \textbf{(T)} (Figure
\ref{Model}).  On long term, late-succesional species from the understory will
take up giving a new state (C, D or M). All states can change to another state
except the direct transition between a deciduous and coniferous stands which
doesn't occur in natural systems. Simulations of this model aims to assess the
transition rate between each state in the overall landscape and identify if
deciduous and coniferous patches are present as alternative stable states. When
a coniferous patch $C$ has been disturbed with a rate $e$, this can be recovered
to another state following $\phi_c$. This term is taking in account a specific
patch recovery rate ($\alpha_{c}$), the availability of coniferous species
($M+C$) and the proportion of paths unconverted into a deciduous state ($1-
\alpha_d \cdot (D +M)$). In making the assumption that perturbation rate is
similar between states, dynamic of a patch $T$ can be formally describe by these
differential equations: $\frac{\delta T}{\delta t} = e \cdot (C+M+D) - T \cdot
(\phi_d + \phi_c + \phi_m)$. If a patch $C$ is undisturbed, deciduous species
$(D+M)$ can spread over the patch with a colonisation rate $\beta_d$ giving a
new mixed patch. A mixed stand $M$ might turn into a coniferous stand with a
sucession rate $S_c$.  We can also summarize the coniferous dynamic by this
differential equation: $\frac{\delta C}{\delta t} = \phi_C \cdot T + S_c \cdot M
- \alpha_d \cdot (D+M)\cdot C - e \cdot C$. At this stage of this project, the
model is spatially implicit and assume that all space is occupied by one state,
so that the proportions of land cover occupied by all types of patch sum to 1.\\

\textbf{Data description.}  The parameterization and validation of this model
will be conducted on the QUICC-FOR\footnote{Quantifying and mapping impact of
climate change on the forest productivity in eastern Canada.} database
containing large permanent (PESP) and temporary (PEST) sample plots surveys
from United- States and Canada. Those data are providing by several forest
offices and covering 3 eastern canadian provinces ($\pm16.000$ plots) and 31
states ($\pm50.000$ plots). Data provides by the temporary sample plot (PEST)
network will be use to validate the model while data from the permanent sample
plot (PESP) network will addresses on the model calibration. Surveys started
since 1970s including until 5 remeasurements varying between 5 and 10 years of
time step and taken across many forest scales: seedling, tree, sapling and
stand levels. Stem informations provide individual based measurements like
diameter at breast height (DBH), species, state of the stem (e. g. alive or
dead), height, age and canopy position. Seedling and sapling datas collected
by subsample provide numbers of individuals  by class of DBH and species. The
stand forest datas include many relevant informations on soil, drainage,
disturbances, cover type and, age and height of the stand. All plot
inventories are geo-referenced in terms of latitude and longitude coordinates
for a specific year. For each plot localisation, some climatic variables are
include and extract by interpolation from the climatic model ANUSPLIN
\cite{McKenney2011}. The state and transitionnal model will take into
consideration essentially rainfall (mm) and average temperatures (degree
celsius) of the previous 30 years the year of the plot sampling. \textbf{(More
details on climatic data?)}\\

To focus on boreal and temperate forest dynamic, some filters will be apply on
this database.  In a first time, on 57 species contained in the current
database, only species the most representative of those communities will be
take into account in the model. Coniferious forest stand will be center on spruces,
larch, grey pine, cedar, balsam fir and hemlock. Deciduous stand will include
ash, maples, iron wood, beech and lime. Finally, post-disturbance forest stand 

Second filter is adressed to sugar maple who is a central species in this
project and particulary well adapted to mesic soil, thusplots with  only this
drainage condition will be considered in this analysis. I will also removed 
all plots disturbed by human activities (mostly forest harvesting) in order to
focus on natural disturbances.\\

\textbf{Paramerization.} 

As previously in the review, model focuses on most representative species of the boreal and temperate forest. Thus 
The basal area ($m^2/ha$, BA) will be compute to provide a measure of relative
growth by species ($i$) present in the plot ($j$) ($BA_{ij}$).

Each plot will be classified into the four different states following their percent of deciduous and coniferious cover.  

To include the climate, each model parameters will be calibrate as a
function of probability based on climatic conditions. % Quelles variables climatique sont intégré ? \\

\textbf{Simulation.} This model will be incorporated in a spatially explicit cellular automaton or lattice in
order to evaluate the velocity of the transition into differents patches and differents
climate change scenario.\\
