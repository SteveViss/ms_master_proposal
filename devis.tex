\textbf{Introduction.} Many ecotone studies and modeling efforts on transition between forest to non-forest ecosystems \cite{Scheffer2012,Scheffer2001,Hirota2011} but little attention has been given to evaluate the transitionnal dynamics of forest-forest ecotone \cite{Goldblum2010,Graignic2013}. Ecotones most present in Quebec consists of a transitionnal area with intermixed fragments of boreal forest and northern temperate forest\cite{Goldblum2010}. This area is hypothesized to shift in the coming decades due to the climate change \cite{Scheffer2012}. Indeed, this zone is of particulary concern as it contains species pushed to their physiological limits, generating a zone sensitive to environmental fluctuations such as those from a climatic change \cite{Messaoud2007,Goldblum2010}. The boreal region is warming twice as fast as the global average and will inevitably alter interaction and composition in the community \cite{Scheffer2012,Hughes2000}. Hence, we expected  this area is undergoing significant natural pressures (e.g. fire regime) increasing in frequency and severity in the coming decades and inducing profound changes due to climate change. Many species of the boreal-temperate forest ecotone are expected to expand or reduce their distribution \cite{Graignic2013,Goldblum2005,Hughes2000} modifying the composition and the dynamic of this ecotone.\\

% Review the transitional sentences to the species Sugar maple (central in this topics).
% Despite macroclimatic conditions favorable to the expansion of sugar maple   
 Sugar maple is one of the most representative species of northern temperate forests \cite{Graignic2013,Messaoud2007,Kellman2004}. Currently some patches have been established in the boreal landscape  and in the coming decades this species is expected to continue to extend its range \cite{Graignic2013,Goldblum2005,Woodall2009}. This northward migration will result in increasing the surface of the ecotone between the boreal and temperate forest of Quebec. The expansion of sugar maple distribution could be difficult and explain by the fact than microclimatic conditions found in boreal forests are different from those present in temperate forest. Colder temperatures from shading and excess soil moisture due to snow melt cause litter to be more acidic and fibrous during the spring. Therefore, even if the regional climate conditions are favorable \cite{Kellman2004}, the edaphic conditions found in the boreal forest could affect the establishment of sugar maple \cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008}. In this case, the sugar maple could be unable to migrate in boreal forests as a result of climate change. This hypothesis correspond with the observations of Zhu \emph{et al} (2012) who revealed than only 4.3\% of migrations are consistent with expansion\cite{Zhu2012}.\\

Our hypothesis proposes the presence of alternative stable states in the transition zone between the temperate and boreal forest as a result of the progression difficulty. Under pressure from the same climatic conditions we would expect to find in boreal-temperate forests ecotone, the alternative stable states consisting of forest patches dominated by balsam fir and an another by sugar maple at same environnemental conditions and inside the contraction zone between boreal and temperate forests. \\

\textbf{Objective.} This thesis aims to determine whether alternative stable states are present in the temperate-boreal forest ecotone and if so, look at the impact of plant-soil and disturbances feedback on the alternatives stables states. To assess this main objective, we will (O1) generate a transitionnal model between the temperate and the boreal forest; (ii) study the equilibrium states based on the model; (iii) investigate the spatial structure of the transitonnal zone; and finaly (vi) run simulations based on different climate change scenarios. 

\textbf{Methods.}
