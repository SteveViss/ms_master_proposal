\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Context.}  The boreal region is warming twice as fast as the global
average and will inevitably alter species composition in boreal forest
\cite{Scheffer2012,Hughes2000}.  Sugar maple is one of those species expected
to migrate northward towards it's nordic temperate forest limits
\cite{McKENNEY2007,Goldblum2005}. Predict shifts in the repartition of sugar
maple under climate change is an important challenge whereas this species is
highly coveted by hardwood and maple syrup producers, two main economic
sectors in Quebec. Indeed, Sugar maple is a widespread and abundant tree in
north-eastern North America and one of the most representative species of
northern temperate forests \cite{Graignic2013,Messaoud2007,Kellman2004}. This
northward migration will result in increasing the surface of the ecotone
between the boreal and temperate forest of Quebec. Nevertheless, the expansion
of species distribution occuring in Nordic temperate forest could be difficult
and explain by the fact than microclimatic conditions found in boreal forests
are different from those present in temperate forest. Colder temperatures from
shading and excess soil moisture due to snow melt cause litter to be more
acidic and fibrous during the spring. Therefore, even if the regional climate
conditions are favorable \cite{Kellman2004}, the microbiota conditions found
in the boreal forest could affect the establishment of sugar
maple\cite{Kellman2004,Moore2008,DeFrenne2013}. In this case, the sugar maple
could be unable to migrate in boreal forests as a result of negative soil
feedback (\textbf{$H_0$}). This phenomen could increase the tension between
the boreal forest and the nordic temperate forest and generating abrupt
changes in the community composition.\\

This project aim to develop a state and transition model (STM) between the
boreal and temperate nordic forest in order to investigate on the shift in the
distribution of sugar maple into the boreal-temperate forest dynamical system.
To realized this objective, we will use the alternative stable states theory
as a framework. The first section aims to present the main objectives of this
master project. In order to define the context of this study, the second
section is a review subdivided into two paragraphs. The first part will
present the theorical context on the alternative stable states and abrupt
changes in ecosystems functionning. Second part of this section will focus on
the Sugar maple and his community and thus explain why is alternative stable
states a relevant framework to study the dynamic of the boreal-temperate
forests ecotone.  The third section of this document will describe the model
and the methodology employed to assess the objectives. To conclude, the last
part will present the general timeline associated to this project.

\section{Objectives} 

This project aims to determine whether alternative stable states are present
in the temperate-boreal forest ecotone and if so, look at the impact of plant-
soil and disturbances feedback on the alternatives stables states. To assess
this main objective, we will (1) generate a transitional model between the
temperate and the boreal forest; (2) investigate the spatial structure of the
transitonnal zone; and finaly (3) run simulations based on different climate
change scenarios.

\section{Review} 

\textbf{Theorical framework.}  Many ecotone studies and modeling efforts on
transition between forest to none-forest ecosystems (e. i. Boreal - Toundra)
\cite{Scheffer2012,Scheffer2001,Hirota2011} but little attention has been
given to evaluate the transitional dynamics of forest-forest ecotone
\cite{Goldblum2010,Graignic2013}. At large scale, transition between  the
temperate nordic and the boreal forests can be approach as a dynamic system
where each forest biomes is a state. The presence of different states at a
location or a time depends on environmental conditions (e. i. Soil,
temperature) encountered by the system. When small environnemental
fluctuations occurs, mostly dynamical system can respond almost linearly with
no particular threshold to observe drastic changes in state of the ecosystem (
Figure \ref{fig1} .A)} \cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009}. Thus, increase the
soil moisture might cause favorable conditions to a new species, but doesn't
affect the functionning of the ecosystem. In this case, only one equilibrium
can be observed given a specific environnemental condition
\cite{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009,scheffer2009critical}. Another kind of
system response occurs more frequently in nature.  Natural systems are rather
insensitive over certain ranges of environnementals conditions while
responding strongly when a treshold is reached by the system
\cite{scheffer2009critical}.  As example, Scheffer \citep{scheffer2009critical} \\

% We used maple sugar basa areal in function of black

% relative abundance using kernel density plot function. We obtained the
% probability of observed a sample plot as function of sugar maple relative
% abundance and mean annual temperature (Figure \ref{fig1}). In both case,
% alternative stable states are presents whereas the function graphed has a

\section{Methods}   

\textbf{Models.} This state and transition model will be based on four
differents states: \textbf{(D)} Decidious; \textbf{(C)} Coniferious;
\textbf{(M)} Mixed stand and finaly \textbf{(T)} Transitional stand. Whereas
parameters previously announced, this model can be formally describe by this
set of differential equations:


\begin{equation}
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{dE}{dt} &= E - E \cdot (P_C +P_D - P_M) \\
	\frac{dS}{dt} &= P_M\cdot E + bC\cdot (C+M)\cdot D + \beta_D\cdot (D+M)\cdot C - S_C\cdot M -S_D\cdot M - e\cdot M \\
	\frac{dS}{dt} &=
	\end{align*}
\end{equation}
%dEdt = E - E\cdot (pC + pD - pM) 
%dMdt = pM\cdot E + bC\cdot (C+M)\cdot D + bD\cdot (D+M)\cdot C - sC\cdot M - sD\cdot M - e\cdot M
%dCdt = pC_\cdot E + sC\cdot M - bD\cdot (D+M)\cdot C - e\cdot C
%dDdt = pD_\cdot E + sD\cdot M - bC\cdot (C+M)\cdot D - e\cdot D

\textbf{Paramerization.} The parameterization of this model will be
conducted on the QUICC-FOR database containing large permanent sample plots
surveys. Those data are provided by several forest offices and cover multiple
canadian provinces ($\pm16 000$ plots) and states (\textbf{Ask at Miranda} plots).
These inventories started since the 1970s and include all stems measurements
and forest stand informations relative to a specific plot location and year. In a first
time, the basal area will be compute to provide a measure of relative growth
of each species present in the plots. \\
